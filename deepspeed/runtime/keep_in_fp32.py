"""Keep the tensors a model names for fp32 in fp32 while the rest of the model trains in bf16 or fp16.

Hugging Face transformers models name these tensors in two class attributes:
``_keep_in_fp32_modules_strict`` (kept in fp32 under bf16 and fp16) and ``_keep_in_fp32_modules``
(kept in fp32 under fp16 only). transformers honors both when it loads a model by itself. Under ZeRO-3,
``zero.Init`` turns every floating tensor created in ``__init__`` into the training dtype, and
transformers' ZeRO-3 loader then copies the checkpoint into those tensors, so the lists were lost.

The main case is the MoE routing bias ``e_score_correction_bias`` (DeepSeek-V3, GLM-4.5, GLM-5 and others),
a buffer. In GLM-5.2 its values lie near 5 to 20 and differ from each other by less than 0.01, while bf16
values are 0.03 to 0.125 apart there, so bf16 leaves 3 to 16 distinct values for 256 experts and changes
which experts tokens are sent to.

``data_types.keep_in_fp32_modules`` selects the names:

* ``"auto"`` (default): the model's own transformers lists, if it has them.
* a list of patterns, matched the way transformers matches them: ``*`` stands for any characters,
  and a pattern may match anywhere in the full parameter or buffer name.
* ``[]``: keep nothing in fp32 (the behavior before this option existed).

Buffers are kept in fp32 in every configuration. Parameters are kept in fp32 only under ZeRO-3 without
parameter offload, the one optimizer that holds partitions of more than one dtype; DeepSeek-V4's
hyper-connection weights, attention sinks and norms, and gpt-oss's attention sinks, are examples.
